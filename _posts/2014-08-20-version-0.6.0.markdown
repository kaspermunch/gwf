The latest stable release of GWF -- although still a beta release -- is now 0.6.0.

New features in this version includes:

* Support for SLURM as the grid backend
* Faster running time when checking status or submitting jobs
* A much improved status output -- faster and more condenced informatino about the targets

The default backend is still Torque but you can change the default -- either local to a workflow or globally -- using the `gwf-config` script.

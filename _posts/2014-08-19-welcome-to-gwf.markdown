We have just built a new home page for GWF using Jekyll and github's pages. It's not pretty and there isn't much content yet, but at least it is a start. Expect some documentation to show up here before long.

In the mean time, try downloading or cloning the the source code and have a look at it. Right now, it should work on both torque and slurm. If you have any problems running it, don't hesitate to let me know.

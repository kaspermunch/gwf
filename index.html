<p>GWF (Grid WorkFlow) is a small utility for specifying workflows to run on a grid with qsub syntax (like Torque). It was developed to help me keep track on my workflows on our local computer grids and mostly driven by the needs I have in my own projects, but the goal is to make a generally useful workflow system.</p>

<p>GWF provides a Make-like system for specifying dependencies between tasks to be run, and it then produces scripts for submission to the grid system, with dependencies between tasks so tasks than can run in parallel will run in parallel while tasks that have to wait for other tasks to complete will be submitted but put on hold until those tasks are completed.</p>

<p>Dependencies are based on files, but unlike Make where several input files can be used for dependencies for one output file, the workflow supports tasks that takes several input files and produces several output files. Tasks then have dependencies on selected files, either produced by one or many other tasks or assumed to be present on the system.</p>

<p>There isn't much documentation yet, but you can find a little bit on the project's wiki pages.</p>

<p>You can see an example workflow <a href="https://github.com/mailund/gwf/wiki/Example-workflow">here</a> and a description of the specification language <a href="https://github.com/mailund/gwf/wiki/Workflow-specifications">here</a>.</p>

<p>A slightly longer example workflow that shows off more features (but essentially doing the same thing as the first one) is <a href="https://github.com/mailund/gwf/wiki/Slightly-longer-example-workflow">here</a></p>
